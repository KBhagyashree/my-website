                        Hi! My name is Bhagyashree Khairnar. 
                        I am a Firmware Engineer turned Front End Developer who loves coding.
                        <br>
                        I am born and brought up in Nashik. After completing HSc. I moved to Pune
                        to pursue my graduation degree in BE E&Tc from Cummins College of Engineering. 
                        I further specialised in Microcontroller based Embedded System
                        Development from the University of Texas at Arlington & received an MS EE degree.
                        <br>
                        I am self driven, ambitious and believe in delivering excellent results. 
                        I am not afraid to take up challenges and try new things out. After my
                        post graudation I have worked with various orgnizations, taken up different
                        roles and thus, have a rich experience of managing clients, working with 
                        teams, managing deadlines and most importantly, I have the required technical
                        skills to complete software development projects. 
                        <br>
                        Other than work I love to sketch, paint, listen to music, travel & explore the
                        city I am in. My favorite pass time is to read. I have a small library of books. I believe a good
                        book can be your teacher as well as your best friend. Books truly have the power
                        to transform lives.
                        <br>
                        I am currently looking for jobs as a Front End Developer and would love to get in touch
                        with you incase you feel I am suitable for a role in your organization or an 
                        organization you know. 
                        <br>
                        <strong> Thank you!</strong>
                        <br>
